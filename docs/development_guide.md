   - Generates scheduling statistics

3. **`report_generator.py`**: Results visualization and reporting
   - Creates charts and visualizations
   - Generates comprehensive reports
   - Provides analysis of scheduling effectiveness

4. **`run.py`**: Main execution script
   - Orchestrates the entire scheduling process
